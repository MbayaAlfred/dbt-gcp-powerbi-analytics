## Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end **data pipeline** using **dbt, Google Cloud (BigQuery), and Power BI**.
The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights

- Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project.
- Access sample data in a public dataset.
- Connect dbt Cloud to BigQuery.
- Take a sample query and turn it into a model in your dbt project. A model in dbt is a select statement.
- Add tests to your models.
- Document your models.
- Schedule a job to run.

## Tech Stack
- **dbt** (Data Build Tool) for transformations
- **Google Cloud BigQuery** as the data warehouse
- **Power BI** for visualization and reporting
- **Google Cloud Storage** for raw data ingestion (optional)

## Architecture Setup
- GCP setup : use sample dataset and 14 free trial account, create service account on google cloud

- dbt setup : create trial dbt cloud account, use GCP service account credentials and connect to dbt instance using BigQueryCredentials

 ## dbt Setup
 1. **Build Model**: Add new data Load sample data **select * from `dbt-tutorial.jaffle_shop.customers** 


![customermodel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/194b814e-6edd-4c12-aec3-4e4035815a79)

    
 3. **Model Persist to warehouse**: dbt allows you to change view to table models: editing the **yml file directly**

**By editing the yaml file directly**

  - name: customers
    description: One record per customer
    columns:

          - unique
          - not_null

          - not_null

  - name: stg_orders
    description: This model cleans up order data
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        description: Primary key
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: status
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['placed', 'shipped', 'completed', 'return_pending', 'returned']
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_customers')
              field: customer_idUploading schema.ymlâ€¦]()


 4. **Build other models**:Separate logic, transform data to add new models for further analysis 
 5. **DCG Diagram** - lineage **: Allows to view existing lineage and dependency

 7. **Add Test to the Models** - lineage **: Validate models are working, test for Referential integrity/ nulls

 9. **Document your Models** Add documentation to your models, share information with team and stakeholders

 11. **Deploy your Models** Create and trigger Production jobs. As business picks up there is need to rebuild source tables and keep data up to date.
